# Greetings! I'm Daniel! Unity Solo Developer 
## Blackhats Games | TheNelist

### **Who am I**

I'm solo game developer. That's my dream of childhood to make myself the most perfect developer of game projects.
I've specialised in game development since I was 11-12 years old. ( Now I'm almost 16 ).

### **Education and Job Experience**
I was studing gamedev at online school Kodland. I completed Unity Game Development and Blender 3D Modeling cources. Besides game development I was learning 
Python and its additional libraries. In the most cases I was doing it on my own. My start in development began in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS** but I understood that It's not mine.
I have my own experience in Freelance. ( Kwork Freelance Marketplace )
I sell offers related to GameDev and 3D Modeling. Usually I create Level Design or just Game Mechanics. Sometimes I work even as game scriptwriter. 
During Game Development I have to learn how to create a pretty trailer or teaser. DaVince Resolve is my best friend in that sort of cases.
